**Overall Summary**

**View 1: Defect Quantity & Downtime by Category**

* **Defects Qty & Downtime by Category (Top Left):** This chart shows the distribution of defects and downtime across different categories: Allied Services, Delivery Logistics, Electrical Work, Mechanical, Other Components, and Packaging. "Mechanical" and "Delivery Logistics" appear to be significant contributors to both defects and downtime, with counts like 2K, 4K, 6K, 8K, 10K, and 12K.
* **Total Qty & Downtime by Category (Middle Left):** Similar to the above, but likely showing the total quantity associated with each category. Values range from 0M to 0.4M.
* **Monthly Count - Defects Outcome (Bottom Left):** This bar chart shows the monthly trend of defect outcomes, categorized as "No Impact," "Reject," and "Zero Defect." It's visible that "Reject" is a significant outcome, with higher bars for months like Apr, Jul, Dec, Aug, Oct, Sep, May, Feb, Nov, Jun, Jan.
* **Defects Details - By Materials (Top Right):** A detailed table showing defect quantity, total quantity, percentage difference CY, and status CY/LY for various material types (Material 1 through Material 15). Material 1 has 62950 defects, Material 11 has 81450 defects, and Material 12 has 100850 defects, indicating these are high-defect materials.
* **Defects Details - By Defects Type (Bottom Right):** Another detailed table breaking down defects by type (Defect 1 through Defect 15). Defect 1 (25700 defects) and Defect 3 (30250 defects) are prominent, with high percentage differences (e.g., Defect 1 has 12.37% Diff CY, Defect 3 has 18.55% Diff CY).

**View 2: Supplier Quality Analysis**

* **Overall Summary (Top Left):** Repeats the 1.34M Total Qty, 825.75K Total Qty LY, 1.31M Zero Defects Qty CY, and 17.72K Defects Qty LY, along with 2.14% Diff CY and 2.15% Diff LY.
* **Defects Qty by Supplier (Top Middle):** A bar chart showing defects quantity for different suppliers. Supplier 4, Supplier 6, Supplier 3, and Supplier 5 have higher defect quantities (4.8K, 4.4K, 3.5K, 2.8K respectively).
* **Defects Outcome vs Count (Top Right):** A bar chart showing the count of defects categorized by "No Impact," "Reject," and "Impact." "No Impact" and "Reject" are the most frequent outcomes, with counts of 13K and 9K respectively.
* **Defects Outcome vs Count (Middle Left):** A stacked bar chart showing the monthly trend of defect outcomes (Defects Qty and Defects LY). Similar to the previous view, it highlights the monthly performance of defects. Months like April, May, June, and July show higher defect quantities.
* **Category Table (Middle Right):** A table summarizing defect quantity, total quantity, and status for each category (Allied Services, Delivery Logistics, Electrical Work, Mechanical, Other Components, Packaging). "Mechanical" and "Packaging" have significantly high total quantities (293350 and 245600 respectively).
* **Location Table (Bottom Left):** A table detailing defects quantity, total quantity, and status by location (Canada, China, Country, Germany, India, Malaysia, Netherlands, Singapore, South Africa, United Kingdom, United States). "United States" (2805 defects, 139450 total) and "India" (4110 defects, 152395 total) are notable.
* **Supplier Table (Bottom Right):** A table providing defect quantity, total quantity, and status for each supplier (Supplier 1 through Supplier 7). Supplier 4 has the highest total quantity (306650) and Supplier 6 has the highest defect quantity (4360).

**View 3: Downtime Analysis**

* **Overall Summary (Top Left):** Repeats 28.67K Defects Qty and 69.56K Sum of Downtime Mins.
* **Downtime Mins by Defects Type (Top Middle):** A bar chart showing downtime minutes attributed to different defect types. Defect 3 (30 minutes), Defect 2 (27 minutes), and Defect 1 (25 minutes) are the top contributors to downtime.
* **Downtime Mins by Category (Middle Left):** This chart highlights downtime minutes by category. "Delivery Logistics" (69 minutes), "Mechanical" (54 minutes), and "Other Components" (46 minutes) are the highest downtime categories.
* **Downtime Mins by Supplier (Middle Right):** Shows downtime minutes per supplier. Supplier 4 (66 minutes), Supplier 5 (35 minutes), and Supplier 6 (32 minutes) contribute significantly to downtime.
* **Downtime Mins by Material Type (Bottom Left):** This chart displays downtime minutes based on the impact category: "No Impact," "Reject," and "Impact." "No Impact" has a much higher downtime of 117 minutes compared to "Reject" (56 minutes) and "Impact" (0 minutes), which seems counter-intuitive and might warrant further investigation if "No Impact" truly causes downtime. *Correction*: The chart title is "Downtime Mins by Material Type" but the labels on the x-axis are "No Impact", "Reject", "Impact". This suggests it is actually showing Downtime Mins by Defect Outcome, and the highest downtime is associated with defects that are classified as "No Impact". This could imply a classification issue or that even seemingly "no impact" defects lead to significant non-productive time.
* **Downtime Mins by Location (Bottom Middle):** Downtime minutes broken down by location. Malaysia (40 minutes), China (33 minutes), and United States (27 minutes) are the top locations for downtime.
* **Downtime Mins by Material Type (Bottom Right):** This chart, despite the similar title to the one above it, actually shows downtime by different material types. Material 13 (30 minutes), Material 6 (28 minutes), and Material 4 (27 minutes) are the top material types causing downtime.

## ‚úÖ **Observations & Recommendations**

### Strengths:

* The majority of units have **zero defects** (1.31M out of 1.34M).
* Clear identification of problem areas (suppliers, materials, categories).

### Areas of Concern:

* High defect rate in **Supplier 4**, **Material 4/5/12**, and **Delivery Logistics**.
* High downtime from **Defect 3**, **Delivery Logistics**, and **Material 13**.

### Action Items:

* Investigate top contributing suppliers and materials.
* Improve quality controls in high-defect categories like **Logistics** and **Packaging**.
* Assess downtime procedures, especially for "No Impact" defects to improve efficiency.
